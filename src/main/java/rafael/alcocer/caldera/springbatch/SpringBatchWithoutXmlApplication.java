/**
 * Spring Batch Application with Spring Boot without using XML configuration
 * files.
 * 
 * The way to process a Step is Chunk Oriented Processing:
 * 
 * Refers to reading the data one at a time, and creating 'chunks' that will be
 * written out, within a transaction boundary.
 * 
 * One item is read in from an ItemReader, handed to an ItemProcessor, and
 * aggregated to a List.
 * 
 * Once the number of items read equals the commit interval, the entire chunk is
 * written out via the ItemWriter, and then the transaction is committed.
